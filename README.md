# Sudoku Game Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Sudoku game using C++ with graphical libraries. The game will provide the following functionalities:

1. **New Game**: Start a new Sudoku game with a randomly generated puzzle.
2. **Solve Sudoku**: Solve a preloaded Sudoku puzzle.

The project will utilize a 3x3 matrix structure of integers, and an object containing a 3x3 matrix of the aforementioned structure, effectively creating a 9x9 grid suitable for a Sudoku game.

## Libraries Used

We will be using the [SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for the graphical interface. SFML is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a simple API to various multimedia components in computers.
